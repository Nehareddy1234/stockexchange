Project Overview: 

Objective: 

The main objective of this project is to create a program to predict the stock market values based on the previous data. 
The datasets that are used are: New York Stock Exchange, Huge Stock Market Dataset, S&P 500 Stock data. 

Data Exploration: 

Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, mpl finance and Matplotlib are imported for data manipulation, building neural networks, and plotting. 
The EDA focuses on understanding the structure and distribution of the data for a specific company within a defined date range. 
The filtered data (specific_df) provides insights into how the stock prices of the chosen company have changed over the selected period. 
The dataset containing historical stock prices over 5 years is loaded into a DataFrame. This dataset includes columns like date, open, high, low, close prices, and stock names. 
A random company name is selected from the dataset. 

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: 

The previously stored stock market data has been collected from various websites for the data processing. 

Data Processing: 

1. Loading data(using dataset in csv format) 
2. Handling Missing Values(dictionary fillna method) 
3. Data Handling(indexing method) 
4. Scaling Data(using sklearn library) 

Feature Engineering: 

1. Lag features(used for capturing historical prices) 
2. Rolling Statistics(for mean and standard devia on) 
3. Technical indicators(for relative strength index) 
4. Dropping NaN values(dropna method) 

Model Selection and Training: 

Stock prices follow a time series pattern, with each price influenced by the previous ones. LSTM networks are great at understanding these sequences, identifying patterns and trends over me. They have memory cells that store and update information, making them ideal for spotting long-term trends. 
The stock market is complex and influenced by many non-linear factors, which LSTMs handle well. They overcome issues with traditional RNNs by remembering important information for longer periods. LSTMs can also process multiple features at once, like market indicators and financial metrics. 
By using LSTMs, analysts aim to uncover complex patterns and make better predictions about future stock prices. They are a powerful tool for time series forecasting. 

Model Evaluation:  

Using LSTM for stock market prediction allows capturing intricate patterns in the data, making more informed predictions. 
Visualizing predictions and evaluating performance with metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE provides a comprehensive understanding of how well the model is performing and highlights areas for potential improvement. 

Conclusion:
